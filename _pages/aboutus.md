<strong>Who We Are:</strong>Tiger is a transformative infrastructure project spearheaded by the University of Memphis, in collaboration with regional research institutions and
industrial partners. This initiative was born out of a critical need to bridge the
significant gap in computational resources available to researchers and educators
in the region. iTiger is using a state-of-the-art GPU cluster that will allow for both internal and external persons of the University of Memphis.
