Tiger is a transformative infrastructure project spearheaded by the University of Memphis, in collaboration with regional research institutions and
industrial partners. This initiative was born out of a critical need to bridge the
significant gap in computational resources available to researchers and educators
in the region.

Prior to the establishment of iTiger, the West Tennessee region, along with
adjacent areas in Mississippi and Arkansas, has been at a substantial disadvantage compared to other regions, such as East Tennessee, in terms of accessible
GPU resources. The available computational infrastructure at UofM and its
regional counterparts was found to be at least 60% less than that of a single
R1 university in the East Tennessee region. This disparity not only hindered
the pace and scope of research but also limited the educational opportunities
available to students aspiring to work in AI and data science fields.

iTiger aims to address and overcome these barriers by providing a state-
of-the-art HPC cluster equipped with the latest in GPU technology, including
NVIDIA 5000Ada, 6000Ada, and H100. The cluster boasts 88 GPUs, offering a
significant advancement in computational resources to accelerate research, foster
innovation, and help to prepare the next generation of AI scientists and HPC
operation workforce.
