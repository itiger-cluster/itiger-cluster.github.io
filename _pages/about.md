iTiger is a transformative infrastructure project spearheaded by the Uni-
versity of Memphis (UofM), in collaboration with regional research institutions
and industrial partners, including notable entities such as FedEx and Auto-
Zone. This initiative was born out of a critical need to bridge the significant
gap in computational resources available to researchers and educators in the re-
gion, particularly in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance
computing (HPC).
