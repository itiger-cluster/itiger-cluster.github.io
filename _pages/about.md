iTiger is a transformative infrastructure project spearheaded by the Uni-
versity of Memphis (UofM), in collaboration with regional research institutions
and industrial partners, including notable entities such as FedEx and Auto-
Zone. This initiative was born out of a critical need to bridge the significant
gap in computational resources available to researchers and educators in the re-
gion, particularly in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance
computing (HPC).

Prior to the establishment of iTiger, the West Tennessee region, along with
adjacent areas in Mississippi and Arkansas, has been at a substantial disadvan-
tage compared to other regions, such as East Tennessee, in terms of accessible
GPU resources. The available computational infrastructure at UofM and its
regional counterparts was found to be at least 60% less than that of a single
R1 university in the East Tennessee region. This disparity not only hindered
the pace and scope of research but also limited the educational opportunities
available to students aspiring to work in AI and data science fields.
iTiger aims to address and overcome these barriers by providing a state-
of-the-art HPC cluster equipped with the latest in GPU technology, including
NVIDIA 5000Ada, 6000Ada, and H100. The cluster boasts 152 GPUs, offering
a quantum leap in processing power, memory, and storage capabilities. 

This setup is designed to support a wide array of research activities across five inter-
disciplinary research areas: intelligent health, cybersecurity, STEM education
technology, smart transportation, and computational biology. By facilitating ac-
cess to such a powerful computational tool, iTiger aims to accelerate research,
foster innovation, and enable the development of cutting-edge AI and data sci-
ence methodologies.
