iTiger cluster requires users to create accounts in order to gain access. This process entails filling out a Microsoft Form in the [Registration Requests page](https://itiger-cluster.github.io/requests/). University of Memphis (UofM) provides cybersecurity and privacy protection (e.g., firewall and multi-facot authentication) and requires a UofM account to access its Internet services. If you are not in the university Internet or an external user to access the iTiger cluster, you need to install and use the [UofM VPN](https://www.memphis.edu/umtech/solutions/vpn.php). Please read the following guide. **Disclaimer**: we will try our best to reply to your requests in time. But due to amount of requests and available staff support, please also stay patient.

## What is an Internal or External Applicant? 

**An internal applicant** is an applicant who has an affiliation with the University of Memphis. If you are an internal applicant, you are either a current student, faculty member or staff member of the University of Memphis. 

**An external applicant** is a applicant who does NOT have an affiliation with the University of Memphis. To access the cluster, you need to obtain an UofM account. See instructions in the following.

## How do I Gain An Account? 

If you are an internal applicant or have a UofM account,fill the form in our [Registration Requests page](https://itiger-cluster.github.io/requests/). 

If you are an external applicant, read below: 

As an external applicant, you will need to have an UofM faculty member offer you a sponsored account. When you connect or collaborate with the UofM faculty, have them view the **[IT instruction](https://www.memphis.edu/its/accounts/sponsored.php)** or go to [UofM service desk](https://umhelpdesk.memphis.edu/) type "sponsored account" into the search bar to submit a ticket request. From there, your faculty collaborator can request a sponsored account for you. 

## Next Steps? 
After you recieve your account, your next steps are to install the required software (potentially a VPN as well). You may follow the "Creating an Account" tutorial in the Wiki to continue getting started to use the HPC.
