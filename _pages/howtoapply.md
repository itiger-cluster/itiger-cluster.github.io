iTiger requires users to create accounts in order to gain access. This process entails filling out the Microsoft Form in the Requests page, installing required software--including the UofM VPN if you are an external user--and logging into the HPC. Please read this guide in its entirety.

<strong>What is an Internal or External User?</strong>
<ul>
<li>An internal user is a user who has an affiliation with the University of Memphis. If you are an <strong>internal</strong> user, you are either a  <strong>current</strong> student, faculty member or staff member of the University of Memphis.</li>
<li>An external user is a user who does <strong>not</strong> have an affiliation with the University of Memphis.</li>
</ul>

<strong>How do I Gain An Account?</strong>
In order to gain an account, you must fill out the form linked <a href="https://itiger-cluster.github.io/requests/">here</a>.

After you submit your form, we will send a request to the University of Memphis IT Department in order to create your account. Once your account is created, we will notify you by email. Please wait between 3 - 5 business days after submitting the form before receiving a response.

<strong>Next Steps?</strong>
After you recieve your account, your next steps are to install the required software(potentially a VPN as well). You may follow this <a href="https://itiger-cluster.github.io/blog/2024/distill/">link</a> to continue getting started to use the HPC.
