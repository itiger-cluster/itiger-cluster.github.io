iTiger requires users to create accounts in order to gain access. This process entails filling out the Microsoft Form in the Requests page, installing required software--including the UofM VPN if you are an external user--and logging into the HPC. Please read this guide in its entirety.

<strong>What is an Internal or External Applicant?</strong>
<ul>
<li>An internal applicant is an applicant who has an affiliation with the University of Memphis. If you are an <strong>internal</strong> applicant, you are either a  <strong>current</strong> student, faculty member or staff member of the University of Memphis.</li>
<li>An external applicant is a applicant who does <strong>NOT</strong> have an affiliation with the University of Memphis.</li>
</ul>

<strong>How do I Gain An Account?</strong>
<ol>
<li>If you are an <strong>internal</strong> applicant,<a href="https://itiger-cluster.github.io/requests/">fill this form.</a></li>
<li>If you are an <strong>external</strong> applicant, read below:</li>
</ol>


As an external applicant, you will need to have an internal UofM user/faculty member offer you a sponsored account. When you have found your faculty member, have them view this <a href="https://memphis.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/page/knowledgebase?origin=null">link</a> and type <strong>sponsored account</strong> into the search bar. From there, your faculty member can request a sponsored account for you.

<strong>Next Steps?</strong>
After you recieve your account, your next steps are to install the required software(potentially a VPN as well). You may follow this [link]({% post_url 2024-03-26-account %}) to continue getting started to use the HPC.
