## Completing the Form

Hello, and thank you for your interest in iTiger! To begin the process of gaining access to the iTiger HPC, you must begin with filling out the form found on the [requests page](https://itiger-cluster.github.io/requests/). Note that the form is different for internal and external users (in this case, "internal" means you are affiliated with the University of Memphis and "external" means you are not affiliated).

Please wait for 3 - 5 business days to recieve a response from the University of Memphis IT department.

## Setting Up Software / Terminal

Once you have recieved an email from IT, your next steps are to set up your device to connect to the HPC.

<strong>For External Users:</strong>
 If you are an external user, it is important to know that the only way to access the UofM HPC is by being connected to the University of Memphis network by VPN. Setting up this VPN is relatively simple--follow these [tutorials](https://www.memphis.edu/umtech/solutions/vpn.php) provided by the University of Memphis.


<strong>For Windows Users:</strong>
 In order to access the HPC, you must download either [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) or [mobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/).

 Once you have installed PuTTY, execute the program, and you should see a window that looks like this:
<br/>
 <div class="row mt-3">
    <center><div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/configuration.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </center>
    </div>

For the entry titled `Host Name`, put in `bigblue.memphis.edu`. Keep the other options as default, and click on `Open`.

<br/>

From then, you'll see a new terminal window open up. When it says `login as:`, put in your UofM username. The password it asks for next is just your password that you use to login to your UofM account.

<br/>
 <strong>For Linux and MacOS:</strong>
 You can gain access by logging in with "ssh" via the terminal or shell:

````markdown
ssh [username]@hpclogin.memphis.edu
````
```` markdown
ssh [username]@bigblue.memphis.edu
````
In addition, X2Go works on both MacOS and Windows. Here is how to connect to the HPC:
<ul>
<li>Host: hpclogin.memphis.edu</li>
<li>Login: username[your UofM username]</li>
<li>SSH Port: 22</li>
<li>Session Type: XFCE</li>

In both cases, after you entered in your valid login information, you should see the words `BIG BLUE` printed onto your terminal:

<br/>

 <div class="row mt-3">
    <center><div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/configuration.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </center>
    </div>

<br/>

You have now learned how to connect to the HPC! For next steps, including learning basic SLURM commands, click [here].

## Footnotes

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a `<d-footnote>` tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote>

---

## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting is provided within `<d-code>` tags.
An example of inline code snippets: `<d-code language="html">let x = 10;</d-code>`.
For larger blocks of code, add a `block` attribute:

<d-code block language="javascript">
  var x = 25;
  function(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
</d-code>

**Note:** `<d-code>` blocks do not look good in the dark mode.
You can always use the default code-highlight using the `highlight` liquid tag:

{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 25;
function(x) {
return x \* x;
}
{% endhighlight %}

---

## Interactive Plots

You can add interative plots using plotly + iframes :framed_picture:

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="{{ '/assets/plotly/demo.html' | relative_url }}" frameborder='0' scrolling='no' height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe>
</div>

The plot must be generated separately and saved into an HTML file.
To generate the plot that you see above, you can use the following code snippet:

{% highlight python %}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
df = pd.read_csv(
'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/earthquakes-23k.csv'
)
fig = px.density_mapbox(
df,
lat='Latitude',
lon='Longitude',
z='Magnitude',
radius=10,
center=dict(lat=0, lon=180),
zoom=0,
mapbox_style="stamen-terrain",
)
fig.show()
fig.write_html('assets/plotly/demo.html')
{% endhighlight %}

---

## Details boxes

Details boxes are collapsible boxes which hide additional information from the user. They can be added with the `details` liquid tag:

{% details Click here to know more %}
Additional details, where math $$ 2x - 1 $$ and `code` is rendered correctly.
{% enddetails %}

---

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
   ⋅⋅\* Unordered sub-list.
3. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   ⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

- Unordered list can use asterisks

* Or minuses

- Or pluses

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Inline-style:

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.
