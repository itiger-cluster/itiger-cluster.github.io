<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/folders.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

To be able to view your virtual desktop on the HPC, install [X2go]("https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php") and choose the version for your computer's operating system.

Once you open X2go, you should see the below. For "host", enter in "bigblue.memphis.edu". Change the bottom left option from `KDE` to `XFCE`. 

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/x2go.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

Save this, then click on the button named "New session" on the right of the below tab:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/client2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

Enter in your credentials, and you should be set!



<h3>Virtual Desktop Tips</h3>
You have the ability to run programs and submit jobs within the virtual desktop (although this may be slower than submitting jobs from your own ssh terminal :)
