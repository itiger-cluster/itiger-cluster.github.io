<h1><bold>Windows:</bold></h1>
If your device operates a Windows OS, then you may download the application [winScp](http://sourceforge.net/projects/winscp/) onto your desktop and use your login information to connect to the HPC from there. From then on, your winScp tab should look something like this, with your computer files on the left and the your home directory on the HPC on the right:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/winscp.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
<!----->

<h1><bold>Mac & Linux:</bold></h1>
If you are utilizing a Mac or Linux OS, then you will not need to install any application--simply utilize the `scp` command on the terminal, after you have logged in to the HPC.
